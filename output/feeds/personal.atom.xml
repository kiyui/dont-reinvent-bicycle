      During this time, many things had happened but most notably that when I
      was in Berlin, I had decided to transition; I am transgender. This post
      will get pretty personal, but serves as a reminder that queer people do
      exist and highlights some of the struggles we go through. Hopefully it
      will serve as an inspiration for other queer people that are still going
      through something similar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="the Berlin Cathedral" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/berlin-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The earliest times I can recall feelings of gender dysphoria was when I
      started to attend secondary school, age 13. Not understanding what I was
      going through, I looked up the symptoms and wondered if it had simply to
      do with me undergoing puberty. I was an already in-denial homosexual,
      knowing that I had guy crushes that I had to suppress and going out with
      girls under the peer-pressure of my friends. At the time, what I was going
      through was still called gender identity disorder.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Asian society is highly conformist and collectivist, with deviance being
      punished. I grew up in such a household as an Evangelical Christian and
      attended an all-boys school with a Christian background. It doesn't help
      that I live in Malaysia;- a country while progressive for being an Islamic
      country, is otherwise very socially backwards. This meant that there was
      no room for questioning or being open about oneself. When I first started
      going through these feelings in my head, I thought I would test my
      boundaries. Scene/emo fashion seemed to be something I could resonate with
      while being very NGC (non-gender-conforming), and allowed for a space
      where people could share how they felt. I was able to get by wearing tight
      jeans and shirts with tonnes of accessories but for my entirety of high
      school had a problem of "misbehaviour" because I refused to cut my hair
      &lt;a id="source-cut-hair" href="#note-cut-hair"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;. I'd have my hair
      cut by teachers every other school assembly and resent seeing a
      hairdresser. I soon discovered the boundaries to which I could safely
      stretch when I coloured my nails. First with liquid correction fluid, and
      later actual nail polish during school break. I got called out by someone
      I knew through my church youth group during a church event and felt
      greatly embarrassed by it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I remember thinking,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;How did I allow these feelings to get so out of hand?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This triggered my first wave of "repression"
      &lt;a id="source-repression" href="#note-repression"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, conformity. I'd
      be lying if I said I enjoyed my time alive then. I was able to keep happy
      on the surface, presenting as the best version of myself there had ever
      been. I started getting good at my grades, being actively involved in the
      debate club, and began actively participating in church activities. For
      some time I even gave my brother my computer, refusing to use it any more.
      The computer meant community, games, coding, and actively keeping myself
      happy. I wanted to withdraw from those feelings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Munich new town hall" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/munich-1.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Some time later, for
      &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawai_Dayak"&gt;Gawai&lt;/a&gt;, my dad
      gifted me with my first laptop/tablet. I was able to geek out again! For a
      while, I was able to distract myself from my dysphoria, ignoring it. Those
      feelings became harder to ignore when I started developing feelings for
      another person at school that also turned out to be queer. Through them, I
      started opening up again, feeling safe to do so. I started meeting other
      queer people and felt less alone, not that I had ever truly been;- I just
      did not want to out myself by associating with the school "pondans"
      &lt;a id="source-pondan" href="#note-pondan"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;. I started dressing and
      feeling like me again, albeit this time in more colour.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Gouda town hall" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/gouda-0.jpg" /&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="a canal in Venice" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/venice-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This period did not last long, but took years to slowly die out starting
      when I entered a cis-het relationship
      &lt;a id="source-cishet" href="#note-cishet"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;. I recall telling her
      that she "had cured me of the gay", and I went through the process of
      trying to be normal. It was around this time that I entered university
      confused and not knowing what I was doing. The relationship was unhealthy
      and eventually fell apart, and I completely let myself go. I was lucky
      enough to be able to go through university without paying much attention
      to classes because I had already spent half my life being a computer nerd.
      I exposed myself to extra stress but at the very least some exposure by
      doing various gigs while at the university. I completed my final year
      project quite easily and landed my first steady income at a part-time job
      while also working as a part-time research assistant at the university
      continuing to work on my final year project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="a church in Munich" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/munich-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      A funny thing about the human mind is that we seem to desire a belief
      system or ideology to lean upon. For me, it had always been free software
      but this being around the time of cryptocurrency's boom, it became much
      more than that. I started getting involved in far more than I could handle
      and tried to distract myself from whatever underlying problems I had. The
      combinations of all these things did lend to me having quite a bit of
      money, but it also meant I was able to sustain heavy substance abuse. At
      some point I was smuggling a bottle of liquor a day to get through my work
      in the research lab.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The research lab is interesting, and what I was working on was also an
      interesting domain. I was surrounded by webcams and CCTVs. If you know
      anything about gender dysphoria, this already sounds like a terrible
      setup. I was constantly seeing myself on every screen and constantly
      resenting my existence. I tried to persist this for months until I reached
      a point where I was no longer able to work. I had to run away or stop
      existing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="Saint Mark's Basilica" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/venice-1.jpg" /&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="the Grand Place in Brussels" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/brussels-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      One persistent dream I always had was to sail out on a boat to sea, far
      away from the sight of land and I'd drown myself. I'd wrap myself in the
      chains of an anchor and lean off the boat. One day, I received an offer
      from a friend of mine for a job as Javascript Developer based in Penang, a
      small island off the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Perhaps
      that's my chance for escape, I thought. I quit my job and left my research
      assistant role without compensation and applied for the job. Given my lack
      of suitable experience, I was offered an internship instead;- another blow
      for my confidence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      After a few weeks at the company, I still felt as if I wasn't able to
      perform up to the standards I knew I was capable of. I still struggled
      with crippling depression and the feeling of dying inside. I then decided
      to gradually delete all social media and disconnect myself from many of my
      friends. The suicide ideation in my head eventually became more strong
      than I could ever manage, and nothing I took could stop me from feeling
      that way. I was on my way home one evening from work and I knew exactly
      what I had to do that night, until I didn't. I received a call from my
      friend asking if I was alright. In spite of all the social media I had, I
      felt as if I was screaming into a void and that there was nobody
      listening. That call saved my life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="a canal in Amsterdam" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/amsterdam-0.jpg" /&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="behind the town hall in Gouda" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/gouda-1.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The thing about a conservative society is that you never feel safe telling
      anyone how you feel. There is no safe space for you to unwind from. In
      that position, I did not feel as if I could seek therapy or counselling
      because I feared being subjected to conversion therapy or something as
      terrible of sort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I wish the story ended there, and that perhaps I had learned to accept
      myself, transition in attempt to relieve my dysphoria. Instead, over a
      year had gone by and I was still living with that torment over my
      shoulders. I did try to make changes, living as a gay man instead of as a
      transgender woman. At the same time, I still enjoyed "passing privilege"
      as a cis-het person because I was not too outwardly gay that it was still
      a surprise factor to people when I came out to them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="the Victor Emmanuel II Monument" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/rome-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Naturally, it only became worse. Partying, travel, self-harm, and
      substance abuse was my only remorse. My suffering was always invisible,
      until it could no longer be. Even after that particularly amazing day in
      Berlin where I was staring at myself in the mirror and thought that I
      could begin loving myself, I was unable to do so once I arrived back in
      Malaysia from my travels. The cycle and pain continued until one day when
      I was in Vietnam, I decided to end my life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="a view from the Vatican" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/rome-1.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      By some miracle, I woke up a few hours later covered in blood. For a
      while, I pretended like nothing happened. I was only back in Penang for a
      few days before I returned to my hometown, Kuching, for a metal concert
      where I told my best friends what had manifested a week before. I needed
      ears before I could accept it for myself, knowing that at least the people
      that meant the most to me were able to accept me.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      I started to socially transition then, testing the waters by going by my
      "Kiyui" surname and they/them pronouns at the
      &lt;a href="http://www.polyglotconference.com/"&gt;2019 Polyglot Conference&lt;/a&gt;
      in Fukuoka. The talk, "Language, Gender, and Social Media"
      &lt;a id="source-fukuoka" href="#note-fukuoka"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;, by Abe Blackburn was
      one talk in particular that stuck by me and reminded me of the importance
      of pronouns and the power in a name. A week later, I attended the pride
      parade in Taipei and had started to present as "Dafne" for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;img loading="lazy" alt="the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi" src="https://dontreinventbicycle.com/images/taking-a-break/tblisi-0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Many months have passed since that entire ordeal, and I'm still taking
      things day by day; Figuring out the things in life I have put in place to
      protect myself and the things I genuinely enjoy. I'd like to thank the
      folks at &lt;a href="https://piktochart.com/"&gt;Piktochart&lt;/a&gt; who've been very
      supportive throughout this process and been there for me. While I still
      &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; "&lt;i id="source-boymode"&gt;boymode&lt;/i&gt;"
      &lt;a id="source-boymode" href="#note-boymode"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;
      when going to the office and am still often misgendered with he/him
      pronouns, it's better than I could have ever asked for.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Still though, I wonder and worry for the future of Malaysia where LGBT
      individuals continue to be silenced and prosecuted, especially those of
      the Muslim faith. I do not know the future of myself and many others in
      this country, where even the 2019 Women's March saw backlash
      &lt;a id="source-women-march" href="#note-women-march"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;
      due to the involvement of LGBT folks. I cannot even personally foresee my
      future in this country where public opinion is still fuelled by hatred,
      intolerance, and bigotry.

&lt;p&gt;I was intrigued by a Kazakh colleague of mine learning that in Russian, the phrase "do not reinvent the wheel" basically is literally "do not reinvent the bicycle". I naturally found that cruelly ironic and took it upon myself to buy such ridiculous a domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a problem many programmers have. In the same manner, starting this site the first thing I did was start writing a build system to compile template files to generate a static site before I went, "wait a minute, surely &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; is the whole point of starting this blog!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before all that, I'm Timur Kiyui. I've been a long-time computer nerd having received my first computer when I was 6. I wrote my dad a letter thanking him for buying me a free computer. By 10 or 11, I was introduced to GNU/Linux by a father of a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started hacking batch scripts before I was able to properly read, also around the age of 10. I attribute much of what I have learned in life to &lt;em&gt;the machine&lt;/em&gt; and the ability to just hack in my past-time. I cannot thank enough the introduction of computers to my life, as perhaps many can relate to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now at age 23, having been professionally employed for about 3 years in a collaborative environment, I find often myself baffled by coding styles or paradigms that others employ in their code. While I know this isn't something taught in universities, it clearly is at the same time not something learnt by years of coding, being junior to many others I'm surrounded with (I am the youngest programmer of my colleagues)! Hence, I have decided that my first article should be on &lt;a href="/identifying-hacks.html"&gt;identifying hacks&lt;/a&gt;. Do enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading; This took me approximately 2 vinyls to write.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category><category term="meta"></category></entry></feed>
